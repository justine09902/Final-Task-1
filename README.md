# Final-Task-1

This portfolio introduces the fundamentals of MySQL using a multi-level corporate database. It involves writing SQL queries, building table structures, and developing relational schemas or ER diagrams. To demonstrate the databaseâ€™s construction, the portfolio will also contain SQL copies of the database and table architecture.
